Davi Bentim's Portfolio

This is my portfolio for the MIT-xPro course

It has a very simple UI and pretty straight forward experience. I did attempt to style the assignment pages but as I am not very experienced yet, I ran into some challenges while styling and applying the features from the assignments into the styled page.

I also ran into a bug where my Animated Map doesn't properly load until I change the screen size, then it automatically adjusts. I did not figure out how to resolve that yet.
